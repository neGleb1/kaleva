OPENING:

Do you know what an anchovy is? It's a small fish that you put on pizza.
Now imagine that the company is a fisherman, and the fish is an advertisement.
The fisherman wants to catch a fish and have a good meal.
Tuna is difficult and expensive to catch, because it is big and strong.
There are also small fish like anchovy.
One anchovy is much smaller than a tuna, but if you catch them in a net, you will have a dinner.

PROBLEM:

Digital media dominates the advertising industry.
Every company in the world faces advertising in social media.
Advertising with popular YouTubers can be very expensive.
Each video of Mr. Beast costs 2 million dollars. Imagine how much advertising costs.
Small bloggers are unreliable and ineffective.



SOLUTION:

I have an idea. What if we take a group of small bloggers and split the money for one ad between them.
It is difficult for small bloggers to find advertisers, so they will be happy to receive additional income.
In addition, a video can become trending, and then the advertising will be even more effective.


Today there are two types of media advertising: media agencies that have contracts with big bloggers and
advertising integrations and automatic advertising videos or banners.
Setting up an agency and signing contracts is very expensive and time-consuming, and banners are ineffective.


My solution combines the benefits of both approaches.
Moreover, we decided not to limit ourselves to YouTube and create networks of bloggers from different media platforms. For example, TikTok and Twitch.




COMPARISON

BLOGGER NETWORK PROS:

- BY PURCHASING A NETWORK, A COMPANY RECEIVES CONTROL OVER IT AND ACCESS TO NETWORK ANALYTICS TOOLS.
THE OWNER CAN ALSO SET UP HIS NETWORK HIMSELF: EXPAND IT OR REDUCE IT; ADD OR REMOVE BLOGGERS.

- ANALYTICAL TOOLS ALLOW YOU TO ASSESS THE BENEFIT OF ADVERTISING AND INFLUENCE ITS EFFECTIVENESS.

- DIRECT INTEGRATION IS ALWAYS BETTER, THEN USUAL YOUTUBE AD.


- IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SKIP OR DISABLE DIRECT INTEGRATION (FOR EXAMPLE WITH AD BLOCKING PLUGIN).
IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISABLE ADVERTISING INTEGRATION IF IT WAS ORIGINALLY RECORDED WITH THE VIDEO.


- IN OUR PRODUCT THE CLIENT CAN SET UP A NETWORK USING SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLATFORMS, FOR EXAMPLE 5 BLOGGERS FROM YOUTUBE, 5 FROM TIKTOK AND 5 MORE FROM INSTAGRAM.
THIS FEATURE IS SIMILAR TO DIVERSIFICATION IN INVESTMENTS.
AN INVESTOR DIVIDES THE PORTFOLIO INTO STOCKS, BONDS AND, FOR EXAMPLE, GOLD TO REDUCE RISKS.
THUS, IF ONE OF THE MEDIA PLATFORMS SUFFERS LOSSES, OTHER PLATFORMS WILL REMAIN EFFICIENT IN ADVERTISING.



YOUTUBE CONS:

- BUYING ADVERTISING ON YOUTUBE YOU HAVE NO CONTROL. ANY BLOGGER WITH A NEGATIVE REPUTATION CAN HAVE A BAD INFLUENCE ON THE ADVERTISED PRODUCT.

- ADVERTISING BUYER DOES NOT KNOW HOW YOUTUBE ALGORITHMS WORK.

- THERE ARE FREE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW YOU TO DISABLE ADVERTISING BANNERS AND ADVERTISING VIDEOS. PERSONALLY I USE ONE OF THEM.
41 million downloads only in chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm
and 9 million in firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/

- ALL YOUTUBE RISKS INFLUENCE ADVERTISING.

- YOUTUBE HAS BEEN SUFFERING HUGE REPUTATIONAL LOSSES RECENTLY.
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF FRAUD AND PORNOGRAPHY ADVERTISEMENTS.
YOUTUBE HAS ALSO ENCOUNTERED A LARGE NUMBER OF BOTS IN THE COMMENTS.



DIGITAL MEDIA AGENCY CONS:







MARKET OPPORTUNITY:

The market size is billions of dollars. This number will grow every year because digital content is consumed by every person on earth.
Here is the number of small bloggers.

So our main customers are little companies. Big companies also can choose the service, but they usually have enough resources
to create a marketing campaign.
